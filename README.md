- You must have Virtualbox installed on your computer. 
	- https://www.virtualbox.org/
	- You don't need to download any specific OS or any environments. This will setup the rest for you!
- Using older version of build-essential. Current does not work well with our version of chef. Git hash: 2bb0bfb
	- We can fix this by installing the chef-solo mod
		- `gem install chef`
